            A digital twin is a set of coupled computational models that

        <li>
            Dependability and security are of five distinctive natures (along
            with functionality, performance, and cost) for computing and
            communication systems.
        </li>
        <li>
            Computing systems and networks with a sophisticated composition of
            multi-level systems and things are inevitably prone to a chain of
            threats (faults, errors, and failures) which eventually causes fatal
            losses, such as service interruption/outage, data leak, or even
            human lives.
        </li>
        <li>
            Even a 1% failure rate is too high, because it causes 3.65 days of
            unscheduled downtime in a year which, in turn, may reduce an
            enormous amount of enterprise turnover.
        </li>
        <li>
            Therefore, dependability and security requirements should be taken
            into consideration to obtain the highest level of trustworthiness
            for computing infrastructures, in practice.
        </li>

            DMS Group is working on the quantification methodologies for
            dependability and security metrics of computing systems and

            (DCN), software defined network (SDN), Cloud-Fog-Edge Continuum
